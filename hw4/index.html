    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>For Homework 4, I implemented a realistic simulation of a cloth. I first created the cloth using a mass and spring model, and then added the necessary forces to each point mass so that it behaves like it would in the real world. Then, I allowed the cloth to collide with other objects and itself. Finally, I created several different shaders to change the outward appearence of the cloth.</p>

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
		As you increase the spring constant, the tension within the cloth increases. For a very low ks, the cloth is much more flowy as it falls, whereas with a high ks, itâ€™s much more stiff.
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
		The major difference between a low density cloth and a high density cloth is the amount of sinkage that occurs on the top edge. What I mean by this is that for a more dense cloth, it will sag more in the area between the two pinned points.
    </p>
    
    
    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
		As the dampening of the cloth increases, the slower the cloth falls/moves. For example, when setting the damping to the lowest possible value, the cloth continues to flip around even after falling as far down as it can, whereas with a high damping value, there is little to no movement after falling.

    <p>
      The pictures above demonstrate the behavior I've described for each field and how they change based on whether the value is low or high. For example, you can see in the cloth with low dampening, its a lot less rigid and more fluid in the movements. This is indicated by the variation of colors shown by the normals. Additionally, a low ks means that there are less strong forces holding the point masses together, so you can see a large dip along the top edge once the cloth settles at the end. Lastly, a high density means that the point masses are heavier which you can see by the cloth getting pulled down in the middle.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Ss you increase the ks, the cloth becomes more stiff and rigid. This can be seen in the images above. For example, for the cloth with ks=500, the cloth drapes completely over the sphere and is more fluid in its movements. However, once you reach the cloth with a ks=50,000, you can see that the cloth becomes less fluid and more stiff, not hanging off the sphere as much.

    <p>
      As the density increases, the folds within the cloth due to self collisions become much smaller. You can see this by the small ripples in the cloth compared to the large ripples in the cloth with a much smaller density. The opposite happens with the increase in ks. A lower spring constant will cause the cloth ripples to be small, whereas a higher spring constant will cause larger ripples. This is likely because the springs are pushing eachother further apart due to a higher ks.

    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is used to change the appearence of rendered objects and is composed of two parts: a vertex shader and a fragment shader. The vertex shader will first transform given object vertices and other vertex properties by mapping them from object space to world space and modifying them as needed based on the desired appearence. Then the fragement shader will compute various attributes of a fragment of the scene created by rasterizing the triangles defined by the vertices returned by the vertex shader. This ultimately decides what we see on the screen.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model is comprised of three main components added together and is used to simulate how light hits various surfaces. The first component is the ambient light or the base level of light that hits every object equally. Next, we add in the diffuse light, which is the light that is scattered equally in all directions by the surface of the object. Lastly, we include the specular light which adds brightness to the ligher spots on the surface caused by reflections of light sources.

    <p>
      The main difference between the Bump shader and the Displacement shader is that the Bump shader only modifies the appearence of the surface, whereas the Displacement shader actually modifies the shape of the surface. This is demonstrated by the rendering of the sphere. You can see how when we use the Displacement shader we actually cause the higher parts of the texture to protrude from the sphere. The coarseness of the mesh also changes how the texture appears for the Displacement shader. When the coarseness was set to 16, we saw that the edges of the texture were less defined, wheras when the coarseness was 128, each corner of the texture was much more defined.
